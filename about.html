          <h2>My name is Missy and living the happy life saved my life</h2>

          <p>
            <strong>I used to be a negative thinker</strong>. I was always overwhelmed with everything and focused more on the bad things than the good.
          </p>
          <p>
            I had a job that I hated, a home that I didn't
            want to live in, and I couldn't hold a relationship.
          </p>

          <h3>How I turned things around</h3>
          <p>
            <strong
              >I was on the verge of a breakdown until I started to meditate and go for walks daily</strong
            >.
          </p>
          <p>
            It wasn't easy at all, but if I couldn't change my surroundings, then I knew I had to start from within. And it worked.
          </p>

          <h3>Now I live the happy life</h3>
          <p>
            Now that I <em>choose</em> to see the positive in every situation, things are so much better. I'm
            less stressed, enjoy life and work more, and I have more free time
            to enjoy.
          </p>
          <p>
            With how much it turned my life around,
            <strong
              >I felt like I had no choice but to start sharing how I did
              it</strong
            >, and how others can benefit from living a happy life as well,
            which is why I started this site!
